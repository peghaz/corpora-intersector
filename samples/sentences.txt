Hello, world! This OCaml compiler runs fast.
The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A cat sleeps near the river, and a dog walks beside the road.
This tokenizer, lexer, and hashmap are useful in a compiler tool.
The bright city is near the ocean; the dark forest is far.
I think OCaml writes code clearly, and it reads input quickly.
Music: piano, violin, and guitar.
